# CORS Front-End Starter Project

This project serves as an introduction to handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when interacting with external APIs from a front-end application. It demonstrates best practices for overcoming CORS-related problems in modern web development.

## Features
- Fetches data from external APIs
- Handles CORS errors in different environments

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-cors-front-end.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd starter-cors-front-end
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
To run the application locally, after starting the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. This project will make API calls and demonstrate how to resolve CORS errors using proxy servers or appropriate headers.

## Technologies
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core programming language used.
